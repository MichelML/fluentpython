# A Python array is as lean as a C array. When creating an array ,
# you provide a typecode, a letter to determine the underlying C type used
# to store each item in the array. For example, b is the typecode for
# signed char . If you create an array('b') , then each item will be stored
# in a single byte and interpreted as an integer from â€“128 to 127. For large sequences of
# numbers, this saves a lot of memory. And Python will not let you put any number
# that does not match the type for the array.
